## Installation

To run PotaBot on your own server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the zip file.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a `.token` file and put your Discord bot token in it.
4. Run `python main.py` to start the bot.

## Events

This bot was also made to allow for easy creation of custom events, for now the only that is implemented properly is `ScheduledEvents` which are events that happen based on a schedule. By default the events will happen every day at midnight but you're able to change the time, to set a special day of the week or even of the month. The following example will send a message to a given channel every monday at 7pm.

```python
@ScheduledEvent(hour=19, minute=0, day_of_week=0)
async def foo(client: discord.Client):
    channel = client.get_channel('channel-id')
    await channel.send('foo')
```

To allow for simple usage, all of those events shall be typed the same as this example and be in [`ScheduledEvents`](src/Events/ScheduledEvents.py)
